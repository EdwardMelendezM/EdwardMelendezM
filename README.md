## 👋 Hello! 
Software engineer with 4+ years of experience. I have worked on medium-sized personal projects in the field of web, mobile, and API development. I am also experienced in working both remotely and in-office environments. I always strive to take ownership of the project and deliver results faster than expected.

## 📚 Writing
Besides developing, I also write on [Linkedin.to](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-melendez-mendigure-b23570281/)



## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
It wouldn't make sense to post every tool and language I've ever worked with, but here are some I am most comfortable with at the moment.
